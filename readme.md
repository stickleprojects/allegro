Allegro first project
Based on the tutorials from the excellent Vivace Tutorial (https://github.com/liballeg/allegro_wiki/wiki)


This project is based on Preppie (atari 8bit)

I havent done c++ for years, so there will be a mixture of c# and java smells around the code
I am a proponent of Git Flow - so lots of small branches too

Happy to receive any constructive criticism
